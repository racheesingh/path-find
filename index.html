<p>Running traceroutes from arbitrary sources to arbitrary destinations is an expensive process. PathCache reuses existing measurements on RIPE Atlas to gather information about the Internet that users can subscribe to. The benefits are two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>The users do not have to spend their own measurement budget to run traceroutes.</li>
<li>RIPE's nodes can be more efficiently utilised since redundant traceroutes will be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<a id="interacting-with-pathcache" class="anchor" href="#interacting-with-pathcache" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interacting With PathCache</h3>

<p>We have exposed a REST API for users to interact with PathCache. This is an easy to use (and work in progress) interface. As of now, our API:</p>

<ul>
<li>Given an AS number (asn), returns the graph constituted by paths to to the asn based on recent data plane measurements.</li>
<li>Given two AS numbers (asn1, asn2), returns the path from asn1 to asn2 based on recent data plane measurements.</li>
<li>Provides an endpoint to get daily updates made to the complete AS graph based on the measurements done in the last 24 hours.
### Developement
As you can see, PathCache is under active development. We hope to improve it incrementally based on how it gets used by us and the community.</li>
</ul>
